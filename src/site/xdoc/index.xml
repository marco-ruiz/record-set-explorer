			GWE's RSE (Record Set Explorer) is an open source system part of the family of GWE (grid wizard enterprise) 
			products. Its aim is to provide a generic; but powerful and easy to use tool for users to interactively 
			explore and manipulate record sets. 
	      </p><p>
			In the context of parameter exploration experiments (domain problem of the GWE system), such tool is 
			extremely useful as it allows researchers to review results of such experiments, its set of input 
			parameters and any other structured record set such as results sets obtained from querying XNAT systems.
	      </p><p>
			Getting started with RSE is simple! Just install the product (as detailed in the <i><a href="guides/install.html">
			'Installation Guide'</a></i>), launch it (as detailed in the <i><a href="guides/user.html">'Usage Guide'</a></i>),
			and use it as demo'ed in the YouTube video embedded on the right.
	      </p><p>
