# Record Set Explorer (RSE)
RSE is a web application dashboard to interactively explore record sets using featured rich javascript custom controls. RSE was built to provide users of the [Grid Wizard Enterprise (GWE)](https://marco-ruiz.github.io/grid-wizard-enterprise/) system with a friendly tool to curate and inspect the inputs and outputs of their parameter exploration experiments.
